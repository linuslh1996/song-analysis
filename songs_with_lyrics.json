That sucks for you\n'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it\nI said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?\nSo buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy\nI call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies\nThat Bubba talk - gotcha open wide\nI giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside\nThis is complicated - at least to y'all it is\nJust let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits\nBut until that day, y'all in deep doo doo\nI never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you\nWhat you need to do, is just admit you love me\nThe South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly\n\n[Chorus]\nUgly - in here!\nHuh, in here!

That's just Timmy talkin'\nGo 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle\nLet's be honest none of us will ever date a model\nSo let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions\nIf you scared, then just forget what we discussin'\nThis that new South - take a picture of me\n'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly\n\n[Chorus]\nUgly - in here!\nHuh, in here!

Everything stays the same\nI just can't do it, baby\nWhat will it take to make you come back?\nGirl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that\nWhy can't you look at me? You're still in love with me\nDon't leave me crying\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBaby, why can't we just, just start over again\nGet it back to the way it was?\nIf you give me a chance, I can love you right\nBut you're telling me it won't be enough\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, baby, I will wait for you\n'Cause I don't know what else I can do\nDon't tell me I ran out of time\nIf it takes the rest of my life\nBaby, I will wait for you\nIf you think I'm fine, it just ain't true\nI really need you in my life\nNo matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nSo why does your pride make you run and hide?\nAre you that afraid of me?\nBut I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside\nThis is not how you want it to be\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby, I will wait for you\nBaby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby, I will wait for you\n'Cause I don't know what else I can do\nDon't tell me I ran out of time\nIf it takes the rest of my life\nBaby, I will wait for you\nIf you think I'm fine, it just ain't true\nI really need you in my life\nNo matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you\nI'll be waiting"

Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya,\n \nlike when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (\nJ.J. Fad\n)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,\n \nyou assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\n \nso that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"\u2014'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock,\n \nshock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues,\n \nbut it's still tongue-in-cheek,\n \nfuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!\nDon't mistake him for \nSatan\n; it's a fatal mistake\nIf you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard\u2014be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a God?"
