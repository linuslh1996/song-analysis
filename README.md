# song-analysis

I looked at the hits of the last 20 years and asked myself some questions about them. Here are the exciting insights.

- Crazy by K-Ci & JoJo was the song that uses its title in the refrain the most (26 times). The refrain goes like this:
````
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinking about you lately (crazy baby)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinking about you, baby (I don't know What to do)
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinking about you lately (crazy, crazy Crazy)
I'm going crazy, crazy (crazy, crazy) when I can't touch you
````
and so on. Crazy!

- I had the feeling that *tonight* is used very often in the end of the refrain. But how often is it actually used? Not so bad actually, it is the 12th most used word. The ranking is the following: 
````
1. you
2. me
3. yeah
4. it
5. baby
6. oh
7. love
8. up
9. on
10. down
11. know
12. tonight
````
- I had the feeling that often, artist sing their song title in the end of the refrain. But how often is this true? Actually, in 25% of cases, the song title can be found in the end of the refrain (only in 10% of cases, it is in the beginning). But very often, the song title is also sung in another part of the refrain.
